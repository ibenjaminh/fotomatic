Hey üëã - This is where I took a broken Fotomatic site and made it awesome. Here‚Äôs the scoop:

## What‚Äôs Fotomatic?
It‚Äôs a website that needed some love. Initially, it was a bit of a mess - especially the CSS. I jumped in to sort that out.

## Why?
Because Chrome DevTools are excellent, I wanted to show that I could use them to fix real web design problems. It was about taking theory to the streets.

## How I Did It
1. **Found the Issues**: Used Chrome DevTools to spot where things were broken.
2. **Fixed the CSS**: Tweaked, tested, and made it responsive. I made sure it looked good on any device.
3. **Iterated**: Kept adjusting until everything was just right.

## Result
Now, Fotomatic shines. Check it out to see the difference hands-on debugging can make. --> https://ibenjaminh.github.io/fotomatic/
